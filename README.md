Customize a form to create a new lead on Zen Planner can be a dificult work, Zen Planner doesn't have API and the only way to add a lead is using a iframe provide for them. As expected the iframe doesn't look good. I wrote a simple script using simple_html_dom to create a POST request to Zen Planner. 

## How to use

- Create your own form
- Get the data and send a ajax request (see example file)
- Configure zenplanner-registration.php with your own informations
- Enjoy it!
